- Temporal Alignment – Refers to methods that synchronize time steps in irregular time series.
- Point Process Modeling – If dealing with event-based time series, this focuses on how events are distributed over time.
- Locality is a widely used concept indicating that patterns in time series are influenced more by neighboring information than by distant one. These patterns tend to exhibit certain dependencies or relationships within specific temporal ranges or intervals. Disregarding the characteristics of locality may result in severe performance degradation.
- Periodicity refers to the recurring pattern or behavior that repeats at regular intervals over time.
- As for the temporal redundancy, it is relevant to the sampling rate when collecting time series and refers to the presence of unnecessary or repetitive information that may not contribute substantially to the underlying patterns. The existence of redundancy in a time series can affect TSF by potentially introducing noise interference. The remarkable progress in deep learning (DL) enables the effective analysis of these features and has significantly influenced the performance of TSF in recent years.
